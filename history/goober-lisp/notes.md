Golang and Lisp
===============

Down the Rabbit Hole

Goals
-----
* Learn Go
* Learn more about functional language design

Why Learn Go?
-------------
* [Rapid Adoption](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers) in the backend server space
* Bleeding edge ops tools we use are being written in it, notably
    - Docker
    - Terraform
* Toolset Enrichment

Why Write a Lisp Interpreter?
-----------------------------
* Avoid getting bogged down in lexing, parsing, compilation
* Focus on interesting language features:
    - first class functions
    - closures
    - tail call optimization
    - macros
* REPL-first, easy to explore and iterate

Go: Early Observations
----------------------

* Transparency over Abstraction
* First-class functions, but not a functional language
* 

Interpreter Outcome
-------------------

* Fib Example
* Basic Macros (when)
* Some Collections Support (map)
* Immutable Data Structures

More to Come
------------

* Plenty of Hackers material here
* Stay tuned
